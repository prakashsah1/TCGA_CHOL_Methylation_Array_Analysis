1. Introduction

In this analysis, DNA methylation profiling of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) was performed using data from the TCGA-CHOL project. The methylation data were generated with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, which interrogates over 450,000 CpG sites across the human genome. Preprocessed data were provided by TCGA through the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) as Masked Intensities and Beta Values, computed with the sesame pipeline. Signal masking and normalization were applied to improve reliability and reproducibility.

The data were downloaded and organized into a SummarizedExperiment object using the GDCprepare() function from the TCGAbiolinks package. This object contained sample-level metadata, probe annotations, and analysis-ready beta values derived via sesame. Alternatively, masked intensities can be downloaded and processed manually with sesame for more granular control over quality control and normalization, which mirrors the steps already applied to the GDC-provided beta values.

Differential methylation between normal and tumor tissues in TCGA-CHOL was investigated. For context and validation, two key resources were consulted:

  1. “Identification of Prognostic Markers in Cholangiocarcinoma        Using Altered DNA Methylation and Gene Expression Profiles” by      Mishra et al. (2020), in which TCGA-CHOL methylation data were      analyzed and the highest density of DMRs was reported on            chromosome 1 and the lowest on chromosome 21 — findings that        were corroborated in this analysis. DMRs on chromosome 19 were      visualized using the Gviz package, producing a plot analogous       to Figure 3 in Mishra et al. (2020).

  2. The Bioconductor workflow “A cross-package Bioconductor            workflow for analysing methylation array data” by Maksimovic,       Phipson, and Oshlack, in which best practices for processing,       quality control, differential methylation analysis, and gene        ontology enrichment of 450k array data were described.

The workflow presented here applies Bioconductor tools to analyze TCGA-CHOL methylation array data and may serve as a template for analyzing other methylation datasets.

2. Methods Overview

After downloading the methylation data with TCGAbiolinks::GDCprepare(), the beta value matrix was extracted from the SummarizedExperiment using the assay() function. Problematic probes were filtered out following standard practice: probes with missing values (NA), probes mapping to sex chromosomes (chrX, chrY), probes overlapping common SNPs (minor allele frequency ≤ 0.05), and known cross-reactive probes (Chen et al., 2013) were removed. Quality control of the filtered beta values was assessed using density plots and multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots generated with functions from the minfi package.

To better approximate normality for statistical modeling, beta values were converted into M-values using the logit transformation. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using the limma package, modeling tissue type (tumor vs. normal) as the primary covariate. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were then identified using the DMRcate package, which aggregates nearby DMPs into contiguous regions of differential methylation.

For visualization of DMRs, the Gviz package was used to create custom genome tracks, including gene annotations and methylation signal profiles, with a focus on regions of interest such as chromosome 19. Finally, gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed on significant probes using the missMethyl package, which accounts for the varying number of CpG sites per gene when testing for pathway enrichment.

legend("topright", legend = levels(as.factor(coldata$tissue_type)), col = 1:length(unique(coldata$tissue_type)), pch = 16)

## Filter probes
# Load 450k annotation
ann450k = getAnnotation(IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19)

# Remove probes with any NA
table(rowSums(is.na(beta_mat))==0) # examine number of probes with at one or more NA

4. Differential methylation analysis using limma

```{r}
# Differential methylation analysis
design = model.matrix(~ coldata$tissue_type)
fit = lmFit(mval_mat, design)
fit2 = eBayes(fit)
# extract results with annotation
ann450k_sub <- ann450k[match(rownames(mval_mat), ann450k$Name), 
                       c(1:4, 12:19, 24:ncol(ann450k))]
DMPs = topTable(fit2, coef=2, number=Inf, genelist = ann450k_sub)
head(DMPs)

# plot top 10 differentially methylated probes
par(mfrow=c(2,5))
sapply(rownames(DMPs)[1:10], function(cpg){
plotCpg(beta_mat, cpg=cpg, pheno=coldata$tissue_type, ylab="Beta values")
})
```

5. Identify differential methylated regions using DMRcate

```{r}
## Differentially methylated regions
my_annotation = cpg.annotate(object = mval_mat, datatype = "array", what = "M", analysis.type = "differential", design = design, contrasts = FALSE, coef = 2, arraytype = "450K")
my_annotation
DMRs = dmrcate(my_annotation, lambda = 1000, C = 2)
result.ranges = extractRanges(DMRs)
result.ranges

# DMRs by chromosome
table(seqnames(result.ranges))
# The highest density of DMRs was reported on chromosome 1 and the lowest on chromosome 21 as also observed in analysis by Mishra et al.
```

6. Visualization of DMRs using Gviz

```{r}
### custom plot of DMRs using Gviz
gen = "hg19" #genome version to be used
dmrIndex = 6 # DMR index. This DMR was also identified by Mishra et al in their TGCA-CHOL analysis (See reference).

# sample group colors
pal = brewer.pal(length(unique(coldata$tissue_type)), "Set1")
names(pal) = unique(coldata$tissue_type)
cols = pal[coldata$tissue_type]

# Extract region of interest
chrom = as.character(seqnames(result.ranges[dmrIndex]))
start = as.numeric(start(result.ranges[dmrIndex]))
end   = as.numeric(end(result.ranges[dmrIndex]))
# Add some padding (25% extra space) to view context
minbase = start - 0.25 * (end - start)
maxbase = end   + 0.25 * (end - start)

## load annotation tracks
# CpG islands file (from UCSC)
islands = read.table("cpgIslandExt.txt", header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
islandData = GRanges(seqnames = islands[,2],
              ranges = IRanges(start=islands[,3], end=islands[,4]),
              strand = "*")
# filter CpG islands to region of interest
roi <- GRanges(seqnames = chrom, ranges = IRanges(start = minbase, end = maxbase))
islandData_sub <- subsetByOverlaps(islandData, roi)

# DNase hypersensitive sites file (from UCSC)
dnase = read.table("wgEncodeRegDnaseClusteredV3.txt", header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
dnaseData = GRanges(seqnames = dnase[,2],
                     ranges = IRanges(start=dnase[,3]+1, end=dnase[,4]),
                     strand = "*", 
                     data = dnase[,5])
# filter DNase data to the region of interest
roi <- GRanges(seqnames = chrom, ranges = IRanges(start = minbase, end = maxbase))
dnaseData_sub <- subsetByOverlaps(dnaseData, roi)

## prepare methylation data
# make sure annotation and beta matrix are in same order
ann450kOrd = ann450k[order(ann450k$chr, ann450k$pos), ]
bValsOrd  = beta_mat[match(ann450kOrd$Name, rownames(beta_mat)), ]

# extract probes overlapping the DMR
cpgData = GRanges(seqnames = ann450kOrd$chr,ranges = IRanges(start=ann450kOrd$pos, end=ann450kOrd$pos), strand = "*", betas = bValsOrd)

cpgData = subsetByOverlaps(cpgData, result.ranges[dmrIndex])

## Create Gviz tracks
# ideogram and axis
iTrack = IdeogramTrack(genome=gen, chromosome=chrom, name="")
gTrack = GenomeAxisTrack(col="black", cex=1, name="", fontcolor="black")

# DMR track
dmrTrack = AnnotationTrack(start=start, end=end, genome=gen, name="DMR", chromosome=chrom, fill="red")

# Methylation data track
methTrack = DataTrack(range=cpgData, genome=gen, chromosome=chrom,
                       groups=coldata$tissue_type, type=c("a","p"),
                       col=pal, name="Beta values", legend=TRUE,
                       background.panel="white", ylim=c(-0.05,1.05),
                       cex.title=0.8, cex.axis=0.8, cex.legend=0.8)

## combine all tracks and plot
tracks = list(iTrack, gTrack, methTrack, dmrTrack, islandTrack, dnaseTrack, rTrack)
sizes  = c(2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 3)  # relative heights

plotTracks(tracks, from=minbase, to=maxbase, showTitle=TRUE, add53=TRUE, add35=TRUE,lty.grid=3, sizes=sizes, main="DMR6 identified on Chromosome 19")
```

7. Gene ontology analysis using missMethyl

```{r}
## GO analysis
# get significant probes with adjusted p value <0.05
sigCpGs <- DMPs$Name[DMPs$adj.P.Val<0.05]
sigCpGs[1:10]

# get all probes 
all = DMPs$Name

# run enrichment
gst <- gometh(sig.cpg=sigCpGs, all.cpg=all)
topGSA(gst)

```
